                <br>
                <h3>Web >>></h3>
                <p class="A">Sir Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist. He was born in London, and his parents
                    were
                    early computer
                    scientists, working on one of the earliest computers.

                    Growing up, Sir Tim was interested in trains and had a model railway in his bedroom. He recalls:

                    “I made some electronic gadgets to control the trains. Then I ended up getting more interested in
                    electronics than
                    trains. Later on, when I was in college I made a computer out of an old television set.”

                    After graduating from Oxford University, Berners-Lee became a software engineer at CERN, the large
                    particle physics
                    laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland. Scientists come from all over the world to use its
                    accelerators, but Sir Tim
                    noticed that they were having difficulty sharing information.

                    “In those days, there was different information on different computers, but you had to log on to
                    different computers to
                    get at it. Also, sometimes you had to learn a different program on each computer. Often it was just
                    easier to go and ask
                    people when they were having coffee…”, Tim says.

                    Tim thought he saw a way to solve this problem – one that he could see could also have much broader
                    applications.
                    Already, millions of computers were being connected together through the fast-developing internet
                    and Berners-Lee
                    realised they could share information by exploiting an emerging technology called hypertext.

                    In March 1989, Tim laid out his vision for what would become the web in a document called
                    “Information Management: A
                    Proposal”. Believe it or not, Tim’s initial proposal was not immediately accepted. In fact, his boss
                    at the time, Mike
                    Sendall, noted the words “Vague but exciting” on the cover. The web was never an official CERN
                    project, but Mike managed
                    to give Tim time to work on it in September 1990. He began work using a NeXT computer, one of Steve
                    Jobs’ early
                    products.

                    Tim's original proposal. Image: CERN
                    Tim’s original proposal. Image: CERN
                    By October of 1990, Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of
                    today’s web (and
                    which you may have seen appear on parts of your web browser):

                    HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The markup (formatting) language for the web.
                    URI: Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address” that is unique and used to identify to each
                    resource on the web.
                    It is also commonly called a URL.
                    HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the retrieval of linked resources from across the web.
                    Tim also wrote the first web page editor/browser (“WorldWideWeb.app”) and the first web server
                    (“httpd“). By the end of
                    1990, the first web page was served on the open internet, and in 1991, people outside of CERN were
                    invited to join this
                    new web community.

                    As the web began to grow, Tim realised that its true potential would only be unleashed if anyone,
                    anywhere could use it
                    without paying a fee or having to ask for permission.

                    He explains: “Had the technology been proprietary, and in my total control, it would probably not
                    have taken off. You
                    can’t propose that something be a universal space and at the same time keep control of it.”

                    So, Tim and others advocated to ensure that CERN would agree to make the underlying code available
                    on a royalty-free
                    basis, forever. This decision was announced in April 1993, and sparked a global wave of creativity,
                    collaboration and
                    innovation never seen before. In 2003, the companies developing new web standards committed to a
                    Royalty Free Policy for
                    their work. In 2014, the year we celebrated the web’s 25th birthday, almost two in five people
                    around the world were
                    using it.

                    Tim moved from CERN to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1994 to found the World Wide Web
                    Consortium (W3C),
                    an international community devoted to developing open web standards. He remains the Director of W3C
                    to this day.</p>

                <h3>Internet >>></h3>
                <p class="A">The Internet started in the 1960s as a way for government researchers to share information.
                    Computers
                    in the '60s were
                    large and immobile and in order to make use of information stored in any one computer, one had to
                    either travel to the
                    site of the computer or have magnetic computer tapes sent through the conventional postal system.

                    Another catalyst in the formation of the Internet was the heating up of the Cold War. The Soviet
                    Union's launch of the
                    Sputnik satellite spurred the U.S. Defense Department to consider ways information could still be
                    disseminated even
                    after a nuclear attack. This eventually led to the formation of the ARPANET (Advanced Research
                    Projects Agency Network),
                    the network that ultimately evolved into what we now know as the Internet. ARPANET was a great
                    success but membership
                    was limited to certain academic and research organizations who had contracts with the Defense
                    Department. In response to
                    this, other networks were created to provide information sharing.

                    January 1, 1983 is considered the official birthday of the Internet. Prior to this, the various
                    computer networks did
                    not have a standard way to communicate with each other. A new communications protocol was
                    established called Transfer
                    Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP). This allowed different kinds of computers on
                    different networks to
                    "talk" to each other. ARPANET and the Defense Data Network officially changed to the TCP/IP standard
                    on January 1, 1983,
                    hence the birth of the Internet. All networks could now be connected by a universal language.

                    Model of Univac I computer, c. 1954
                    The image above is a scale model of the UNIVAC I (the name stood for Universal Automatic Computer)
                    which was delivered
                    to the Census Bureau in 1951. It weighed some 16,000 pounds, used 5,000 vacuum tubes, and could
                    perform about 1,000
                    calculations per second. It was the first American commercial computer, as well as the first
                    computer designed for
                    business use. (Business computers like the UNIVAC processed data more slowly than the IAS-type
                    machines, but were
                    designed for fast input and output.) The first few sales were to government agencies, the A.C.
                    Nielsen Company, and the
                    Prudential Insurance Company. The first UNIVAC for business applications was installed at the
                    General Electric Appliance
                    Division, to do payroll, in 1954. By 1957 Remington-Rand (which had purchased the Eckert-Mauchly
                    Computer Corporation in
                    1950) had sold forty-six machines.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Address Resolution divrotocol.</b>ARP translates IP addresses to Media Access Control
                            (MAC)
                            addresses and vice versa so LAN
                            endpoints can communicate with one another. ARP is necessary because IP and MAC addresses
                            are
                            different lengths: IP
                            version 4 (IPv4) addresses are 32 bits long, IPv6 addresses are 128 bits and MAC addresses
                            -- a
                            device's physical
                            hardware number -- are 12 hexadecimal digits split into six pairs. Translations must occur
                            for
                            proper device
                            communication.

                            ARP isn't required every time devices attempt to communicate because the LAN's host stores
                            the
                            translated addresses in
                            its ARP cache, so this process is mainly used when new devices join the network.</li>
                        <li><b>Border Gateway Protocol.</b>BGP makes the internet work. This routing protocol controls
                            how
                            packets pass through routers in an autonomous system
                            (AS) -- one or multiple networks run by a single organization or provider -- and connect to
                            different networks. BGP can
                            connect endpoints on a LAN to one another, and it can connect endpoints in different LANs to
                            one
                            another over the
                            internet.

                            External BGP directs network traffic from various ASes to the internet and vice versa.
                            Additionally, internal BGP
                            directs network traffic between endpoints within a single AS.</li>
                        <li><b>Domain name system.</b>DNS is a database that includes a website's domain name, which
                            people use to access the website, and its corresponding
                            IP addresses, which devices use to locate the website. DNS translates the domain name into
                            IP addresses, and these
                            translations are included within the DNS. Servers can cache DNS data, which is required to
                            access the websites. DNS also
                            includes the DNS protocol, which is within the IP suite and details the specifications DNS
                            uses to translate and
                            communicate.

                            DNS is important because it can quickly provide users with information, as well as access to
                            remote hosts and resources
                            across the internet.</li>
                        <li><b>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.</b>DHCP assigns IP addresses to network endpoints so
                            they can communicate with other network endpoints over IP. Whenever a
                            device joins a network with a DHCP server for the first time, DHCP automatically assigns it
                            a new IP address and
                            continues to do so each time a device moves locations on the network.

                            When a device connects to a network, a DHCP handshake takes place, where the device and DHCP
                            server communicate. The
                            device establishes a connection; the server receives it and provides available IP addresses;
                            the device requests an IP
                            address; and the server confirms it to complete the process.</li>
                        <li><b>File Transfer Protocol.</b>FTP is a client-server protocol, with which a client requests
                            a file and the server supplies it. FTP runs over TCP/IP --
                            a suite of communications protocols -- and requires a command channel and a data channel to
                            communicate and exchange
                            files, respectively. Clients request files through the command channel and receive access to
                            download, edit and copy the
                            file, among other actions, through the data channel.

                            FTP has grown less popular as most systems began to use HTTP for file sharing. However, FTP
                            is a common network protocol
                            for more private file sharing, such as in banking.</li>
                        <li><b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol.</b>Like FTP, HTTP is a file sharing protocol that runs over
                            TCP/IP, although HTTP primarily works over web browsers and is
                            commonly recognizable for most users. When a user enters a website domain and aims to access
                            it, HTTP provides the
                            access. HTTP connects to the domain's server and requests the site's HTML, which is the code
                            that structures and
                            displays the page's design.

                            Another form of HTTP is HTTPS, which stands for HTTP over Secure Sockets Layer or HTTP
                            Secure. HTTPS can encrypt a
                            user's HTTP requests and webpages. This provides more security to users and can prevent
                            common cybersecurity threats,
                            such as man-in-the-middle attacks.</li>
                        <li><b>Internet Protocol.</b>IP functions similarly to a postal service. When users send and
                            receive data from their device, the data gets spliced
                            into packets, which are like letters with two IP addresses: one for the sender and one for
                            the recipient. After the
                            packet leaves the sender, it goes to a gateway, like a post office, that directs it in the
                            proper direction. Packets
                            continue to travel through gateways until they reach their destinations.

                            IP is commonly paired with TCP to form TCP/IP, the overall internet protocol suite.
                            Together, IP sends packets to their
                            destinations, and TCP arranges the packets in the correct order, as IP sometimes sends
                            packets out of order to ensure
                            the packets travel the fastest ways.</li>
                        <li><b>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.</b>SMTP is the most popular email protocol, is part of the
                            TCP/IP suite and controls how email clients send users' email
                            messages. Email servers use SMTP to send email messages from the client to the email server
                            to the receiving email
                            server. However, SMTP doesn't control how email clients receive messages -- just how clients
                            send messages.

                            That said, SMTP requires other protocols to ensure email messages are sent and received
                            properly. SMTP can work with
                            Post Office Protocol 3 or Internet Message Access Protocol, which control how an email
                            server receives email messages.</li>
                        <li><b>Telnet.</b>Telnet is designed for remote connectivity, and it establishes connections
                            between a remote endpoint and a host machine
                            to enable a remote session. Telnet prompts the user at the remote endpoint to log on and,
                            once authenticated, gives the
                            endpoint access to network resources and data at the host computer.

                            Telnet has existed since the 1960s and was arguably the first draft of the modern internet.
                            However, Telnet lacks
                            sophisticated security protections required for modern communications and technology, so it
                            isn't commonly used anymore.</li>
                        <li><b>Transmission Control Protocol.</b>TCP is the other half of TCP/IP and arranges packets in
                            order so IP can deliver them. Specifically, TCP numbers
                            individual packets because IP can send packets to their destinations through different
                            routes and get them out of order,
                            so TCP amends this before IP delivers the packets.

                            TCP also detects errors in the sending process -- including if any packets are missing based
                            on TCP's numbered system --
                            and requires IP to retransmit those packets before IP delivers the data to its destination.
                            Through this process, the
                            TCP/IP suite controls communication across the internet.</li>
                        <li><b>User Datagram Protocol.</b>UDP is an alternative to TCP and also works with IP to
                            transmit time-sensitive data. UDP enables low-latency data
                            transmissions between internet applications, so this protocol is ideal for voice over IP or
                            other audio and video
                            requirements. Unlike TCP, UDP doesn't wait for all packets to arrive or organize the
                            packets. Instead, UDP transmits all
                            packets even if some haven't arrived.

                            UDP solely transmits packets, while TCP transmits, organizes and ensures the packets arrive.
                            While UDP works more
                            quickly than TCP, it's also less reliable.</li>

                <p class="Q">Explain features of java?</p>
                <br>
                <p class="A">The primary objective of Java programming language creation was to make it portable, simple
                    and secure programming
                    language. Apart from this, there are also some excellent features which play an important role in
                    the popularity of this
                    language. The features of Java are also known as java buzzwords.
                    <br>

                    A list of most important features of Java language is given below.
                    <br>
                    Java Features
                <ol class="absolute-fill">
                    <li>Simple</li>
                    <li>Object-Oriented</li>
                    <li>Portable</li>
                    <li>Platform independent</li>
                    <li>Secured</li>
                    <li>Robust</li>
                    <li>Architecture neutral</li>

                    <li>Distributed</li>
                    <li>Dynamic</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <h6>Simple</h6>
                <p>Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand. According to Sun,
                    Java language is a
                    simple programming language because:

                    <br>
                    Java syntax is based on C++ (so easier for programmers to learn it after C++).
                    <br>
                    Java has removed many complicated and rarely-used features, for example, explicit pointers, operator
                    overloading, etc.
                    <br>
                    There is no need to remove unreferenced objects because there is an Automatic Garbage Collection in
                    Java.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h6>Object-oriented</h6>
                <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object. Object-oriented
                    means we organize our
                    software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporates both data and behavior.

                    Object-oriented programming (OOPs) is a methodology that simplifies software development and
                    maintenance by providing
                    some rules.

                    Basic concepts of OOPs are:
                    <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Object</li>
                    <li>Class</li>
                    <li>Inheritance</li>
                    <li>Polymorphism</li>
                    <li>Abstraction</li>
                    <li>Encapsulation</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h6>Platform Independent</h6>
                <p>
                    Java is platform independent because it is different from other languages like C, C++, etc. which
                    are compiled into
                    platform specific machines while Java is a write once, run anywhere language. A platform is the
                    hardware or software
                    environment in which a program runs.

                    There are two types of platforms software-based and hardware-based. Java provides a software-based
                    platform.

                    The Java platform differs from most other platforms in the sense that it is a software-based
                    platform that runs on the
                    top of other hardware-based platforms. It has two components:
                    <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Runtime Environment</li>
                    <li>API(Application Programming Interface)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Java code can be run on multiple platforms, for example, Windows, Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac/OS, etc. Java
                code is compiled
                by the compiler and converted into bytecode. This bytecode is a platform-independent code because it can
                be run on
                multiple platforms, i.e., Write Once and Run Anywhere(WORA).</p>
                <br>
                <h6>Secured</h6>
                <p>Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus-free systems. Java is secured
                    because:
                    <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>No explicit pointer</li>
                    <li>Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox
                        how Java is secured</li>
                    <li>Classloader: Classloader in Java is a part of the Java Runtime Environment(JRE) which is used to
                        load Java classes into
                        the Java Virtual Machine dynamically. It adds security by separating the package for the classes
                        of the local file
                        system from those that are imported from network sources.</li>
                    <li>Bytecode Verifier: It checks the code fragments for illegal code that can violate access right
                        to objects.</li>
                    <li>Security Manager: It determines what resources a class can access such as reading and writing to
                        the local disk.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Java language provides these securities by default. Some security can also be provided by an application
                developer
                explicitly through SSL, JAAS, Cryptography, etc.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h6>Robust</h6>
                <p>Robust simply means strong. Java is robust because:
                    <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>It uses strong memory management.</li>
                    <li>There is a lack of pointers that avoids security problems.</li>
                    <li>There is automatic garbage collection in java which runs on the Java Virtual Machine to get rid
                        of objects which are not
                        being used by a Java application anymore.</li>
                    <li>
                        There are exception handling and the type checking mechanism in Java. All these points make Java
                        robust.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h6>Architecture-neutral</h6>
                <p>Java is architecture neutral because there are no implementation dependent features, for example, the
                    size of primitive
                    types is fixed.

                    In C programming, int data type occupies 2 bytes of memory for 32-bit architecture and 4 bytes of
                    memory for 64-bit
                    architecture. However, it occupies 4 bytes of memory for both 32 and 64-bit architectures in Java.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h6>Portable</h6>
                <p>Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform. It doesn't
                    require any
                    implementation.</p>
                <br>
                <h6>High-performance</h6>
                <p>Java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages because Java bytecode is
                    "close" to native code.
                    It is still a little bit slower than a compiled language (e.g., C++). Java is an interpreted
                    language that is why it is
                    slower than compiled languages, e.g., C, C++, etc.</p>
                <br>
                <h6>Distributed</h6>
                <p>Java is distributed because it facilitates users to create distributed applications in Java. RMI and
                    EJB are used for
                    creating distributed applications. This feature of Java makes us able to access files by calling the
                    methods from any
                    machine on the internet.</p>
                <br>
                <h6>Multi-threaded</h6>
                <p>A thread is like a separate program, executing concurrently. We can write Java programs that deal
                    with many tasks at
                    once by defining multiple threads. The main advantage of multi-threading is that it doesn't occupy
                    memory for each
                    thread. It shares a common memory area. Threads are important for multi-media, Web applications,
                    etc.</p>
                <br>
                <h6>Dynamic</h6>
                <p>Java is a dynamic language. It supports dynamic loading of classes. It means classes are loaded on
                    demand. It also
                    supports functions from its native languages, i.e., C and C++.

                    Java supports dynamic compilation and automatic memory management (garbage collection).</p>
